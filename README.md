# Edu-Management-System-1
This is my file project. I continue to learn Java step by step.
I used Solid, dry, kiss from the OOP, FILE and clean code writing principles that I learned.
The dean and laboratory assistant can access the project. The dean logs in - lab assistants can add and view student scores.
Lab assistant login - only student can add. This is the latest version that will be updated.
